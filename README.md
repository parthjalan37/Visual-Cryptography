# Visual-Cryptography
#### Using Python and OpenCV to implement two cryptography algorithms: one which uses AES encryption & decryption and another which uses bit-level encryption to generate two shares which when superposed, the secret image is revealed.
<br/>

Here are sample results:  

**Advance Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm**:
